## Custom Blocks for Gutenberg: A Modern Developer's Starter Kit [Revised]

Embark on your journey into developing custom **Gutenberg Blocks** with our refined developer's starter kit. Unlike **@wordpress/create-block**, our kit leverages **@wordpress/scripts** for a more efficient and nuanced development experience, offering key distinctions in functionality and structure.

## Comparing Our Kit with @wordpress/create-block

Wondering why to opt for this toolkit over @wordpress/create-block, given the similarities in their underlying dependencies? Hereâ€™s the rationale:

-   **Key Advantage:** The @wordpress/create-block toolkit is designed for crafting a single block per plugin. If your project entails creating several blocks within one plugin, our starter kit is your go-to resource. Itâ€™s engineered for facilitating **Multiple Blocks in a Single Plugin**.
-   **Organization Plus:** We've structured the files in our Gutenberg Boilerplate more methodically compared to @wordpress/create-block.

## Kickstarting Development

**First, clone the repository in your WordPress plugin directory. Then, activate the plugin.**

This kit initiates a new plugin featuring a basic custom Gutenberg block and a custom block category. The sample block is titled **Bootstrap Block**, nestled under the **BOILERPLATE** category.

To begin, navigate to the kit's folder (feel free to rename it as needed) and execute the command below to install npm:

```
$ npm install
```

This command will install all necessary node_modules, setting the stage for you to dive into custom block creation. For real-time editing and feedback, use:

```
$ npm start
```

When you're ready to roll out your project, compile your development with:

```
$ npm run build
```

## Adding New Blocks to Your Plugin

Follow these guidelines to include new blocks in your plugin:

1. **New Folder:** Under the **src/blocks** directory, create a new folder for your block. E.g., for a **box** block, create a folder named **box** at **src/blocks/box**.
2. **Block Files:** Store all required block files within this new folder.
3. **Index Inclusion:** In the main **src/index.js**, import your block's **index.js** file. The pattern should resemble: **import './blocks/box/index';**
4. **Block Registration:** In the main plugin PHP file (modifiable but defaults to **plugin.php** in our kit), locate the block registration function (default **kit_register_block()**). Add your new block's name to the **blocksList** array.

**NOTE**: *Using a unique prefix for your blocks is advisable. In our case, we used the prefix **kit** and **KIT***.

## Best Practices for Development

Start with **npm run build** for initial block registration, then proceed with **npm start** for ongoing edits and improvements.
